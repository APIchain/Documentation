# Bottos Architecture

Bottos is a basic infrastructure which focuses on the field of artificial intelligence. It is not only a public underlying blockchain based on data, but it is also a data exchange platform serving the whole artificial intelligence and its derivative industries.
The data exchange upon Bottos' blockchain is the world's largest data collection pool based on blockchain technology, addressing the difficult pain points of high-quality data acquisition in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, creating smart data equity contracts, using data mining to achieve personal data wealth sharing, and establishing a value link between personal data and AI models.

Therefore, the hierarchical architecture is adopted in the design of Bottos system, which facilitates the dynamic expansion and flexible deployment of the system. The overall system is divided into three layers, as shown below.

Core layer: The Chainbase layer, providing chain service based on blockchain, constructing trust public chain infrastructure and realizing the basic function of block chain.

Service Layer: Provides basic services based on Bottos chain development based on Chainbase, such as providing distributed identity services, distributed storage, contracts and token management services, in order to achieve rapid DApp development;

Application Layer: A collection of applications based on Bottos development.

Currently, this article chiefly introduces how to use the services of core layer, (that is to say, the block chainâ€™s basic services), and we provide the corresponding development interface and use cases, the basic interface and mode of wallet.

The overall technical architecture of the Bottos system is shown in the following figure.
