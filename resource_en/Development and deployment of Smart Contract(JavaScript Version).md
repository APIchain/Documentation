# 1. Using C++ to Write Smart Contracts

`Note:`  
This tutorial is based on the node.js development environment. If you do not have it installed on your computer, please install the node.js environment yourself.

## 1.1. Initialize the project

Download contracts integrated development framework `contract-tool-js`, and initialize the project

```
sudo npm i contract-tool-js -g
contract-tool-js init MyDapp
cd MyDapp
```

The following project structure can be generated by the appeal initialization step

```
- config
    - config.js //Store your configuration files
    - keystore.json  // Store your deployment contractor's keystore secret key file
- contract
    - abi.json  // An Abi structure for placing smart contracts
    - contract.js // Store your smart contract codes
- tools  
    - deploy.js  // Store your smart contract deploy codes
- test  
    - test.js  // Store your smart contract testing codes
```

## 1.2. Developing for Smart Contract and ABI

The smart contract is developed under the directory of `contract`

File `contract/contract.js`: Store the smart contract codes
File `contract/abi.json`: The abi description file that corresponding to smart contract

Bottos currently supports only single-contract files with the following points:

```
1. Cannot use NPM installed third-party dependencies
2. Only contract file deployment is supported under one account, not multi-contract file deployment
```

The abi file describes the template as follows.

```
{
    "to":{"type":"string"},
    "value":{"type":"uint32"},
    "from":{"type":"string"},
    "contract":{
      "type":"object",
      "name":{"type":"string"},
      "sdfkjds":{
        "type":"object",
        "ksjdfl":{"type":"string"}
      }
    }
}
```

There are several types of all fields

```
uint8
uint16
uint32
uint64
uint256
string
bin16
object
array
```

## 1.3. Deploy the Smart Contract and ABI

After the smart contract and ABI have been developed done, we need to deploy the smart contract and ABI files to the chain.

`Note:`You can create an account with Bottos's official wallet to get the keystore.

- Paste the account's `keystore` entire file contents into file `config/keystore json`
- Configure the `keystore_pwd` from the keystore's account in file `config/config.js`
- Run the command to deploy the contract and ABI files

```
npm run deployContract  // Deploy the smart contract
npm run deployAbi  // Deploy the ABI file
```

## 1.4. Testing your Smart Contract

Write the testing codes in file `test/test.js` and run following command to test that smart contract.

```
npm test
```
