<p>Bottos is an infrastructure built for the artificial intelligence, and its underlying public blockchain hasn&apos;t only been designed based on data, but it is also meant as a data circulation platform serving the whole artificial intelligence and its derivative industries. By means of data mining and using smart contracts, Bottos realizes a consensus-based, scalable, easy-to-develop, and collaborative one-stop application platform based on data, models, calculation, and storage of multi-tiered shared services.</p>
<p>Bottos can be deployed in fields such as big data, artificial intelligence, smart hardware, robotics, IOT, VR/AR, etc,. Simply put, it is not just an artificial intelligence public chain, it also offers data and models exchange services, which realizes the exchange value of artificial intelligence and its industry based on data feeding, finally forming a new ecosystem of distributed AI.</p>
<p>As a public chain designed to support the artificial intelligence industry, Bottos&#x2019; performance advantages are focused in the data exchange, as well as calculation power, shared storage and so on, with strong industrial attributes. Its original technical features include: Intelligent Currency Design, Lottery DPOS algorithm and Distributed Storage with AI algorithm, which has a leading competitive advantage in data privacy protection, oversize data storage and so on.</p>
<p>The target of Bottos public chain is to create a decentralized data exchange platform and to solve the difficult pain points of artificial intelligence training data acquisition, then attract artificial intelligence and its derivative industries to actively enter the platform. Through data and model certainty, users are encouraged to share and speed up the volume of transactions. Through the smart contract lifecycle management, Bottos helps AI and its derivative industries eliminate trust costs and increase efficiency.</p>
<p>The application development layer of Bottos is chiefly based on DApps which will be divided into three categories: Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence Derivative and Block Chain Technical Service categories. The blockchain technology is always through continuing iterations, such as Lightning Network, ORALCE, side chain, cross-chain, etc.,; In order to improve the Bottos ecosystem, the artificial intelligence DApp is represented by simple software, including the features of data feeding model iterative upgrading; Artificial intelligence related Dapps which include intelligent hardware (in the form of combination of software and hardware), IOT, robots, etc., collects new data through hardwares that are the source channels of AI data. These DApps form a closed loop of data between each other, which can eventually form a global scale of data pools, while there is also a demand between DApps smart modules to form a demand map through blockchain technology, which will eventually result in a large pool of modules.</p>
