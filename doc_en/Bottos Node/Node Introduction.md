# Node Introduction

Bottos nodes are divided into: basic service nodes, application-oriented nodes, light nodes and ultra-light nodes. Each node checks and balances and complements each other, forming a dynamic balance of the self-consistent node system.

## (1) Basic service nodes
The Basic Service node provides the fundamental  service of the whole Bottos blockchain system, in addition to supporting the core functions of the blockchain core, such as transaction consensus, contract deployment, block production, etc., it also supports the main functions that provided by the Bottos service layer, such as unified identity system, storage management services, credit services, Token management and contract management and other key functions, to provide the most important production services for the overall Bottos network.

## (2) Application nodes
The kind of application node primarily serves different Dapps’ deployments in the ecosystem, and application node can be deployed on itself, or be deployed on the fundamental nodes. (Logical applications on each fundamental node can charge a certain deployment threshold fee in future.)

## (3) Lightweight nodes
The lightweight node chiefly works as the data verification node of Bottos, and it does not provide the corresponding function of the service layer. It only carries on the block data’s synchronization and so on, and can also support the Bottos core Layer basic service.

## (4) Ultra lightweight nodes
The ultra lightweight node chiefly handles the block correlation head verification, and synchronizes the key hash data, etc.
