# Network Topology

### Super node network

The super node undertakes the implementation and the writing of the records of all transactions in the whole network, it is the fundation of the overall stability of the global network. Therefore,  Bottos uses a fully connected mode of networking by its super node's network-building design, shown as the following figure (for instance, the full connection of 10 super nodes. The actual number of super nodes is 49, amnong which 29 members will be elected in each round, the other 20 nodes are spare nodes)

### Connection diagram among genernal and super nodes

The network among the nodes other than super nodes are loosely organized, just similar to the mesh-structure-connected way in the following figure.
